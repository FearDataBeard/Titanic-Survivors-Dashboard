# Titanic Survival Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to explore and visualize survival trends from the historic Titanic dataset. This project analyzes survival likelihood across multiple factors, including passenger class, age group, gender, and embarkation port.

The dashboard is designed for intuitive exploration, enabling users to filter, slice, and uncover deeper insights into survival patterns based on social and demographic variables.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX (Calculated Columns and Measures)
- Data Modeling
- Data Slicers and Filters
- Conditional Formatting

## Project Highlights
- Visualized survival rates by class, gender, age, and embarkation point
- Built dynamic slicers for multi-dimensional filtering and deep dive analysis
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight survival vs. non-survival groups
- Created a clean, story-driven user experience focusing on demographic insights
